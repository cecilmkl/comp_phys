Simulation of the two-dimensional Ising Model (Project 3)
-------------------------------------------------
The model will be used to explore temperature-dependent behaviour in ferromagnets and numerically estimate the critical temperature at which 
our 2D system undergoes a phase transition, from a magnetized phase to a phase with no net magnetization.
