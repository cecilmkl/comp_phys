## Folder content
This folder contains the python scipts used for plotting. Alle the plotfiles save their figure to the `project5/figures/` folder.

## Scripts
### `Animation.py`
This scrips creates the animation of the simulation of both the probability function, and the real and imaginary part of u. It also creates snapshots of the animation if requested in the input arguments. These are specified in the `makefile` in the `project5/` folder. Note what this simulation aslo caluclates the complex conjugate of u, as we had some trouble with getting compex conjugate in cpp to work.
