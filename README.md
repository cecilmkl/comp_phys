# Computational Physics

---------------
Folder for files for FYS3150/4150 Computational Physics at University of Oslo Fall 2021. Code written in C++ and plotting code in Python. 
The code for each project is located in their respective folders, with full scientific reports for Project 3-5.

## Project 1: Numerical solution to the one-dimensional Poisson equation by converting the second derivative to a solvable matrix equation Av = g.

## Project 2: Numerical solution of an eigenvalue problem exemplified by a special case of the one-dimensional buckling beam.

## Project 3: Simulation of a Penning trap

## Project 4:

## Project 5:
